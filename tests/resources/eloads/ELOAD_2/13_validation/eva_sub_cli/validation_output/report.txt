METADATA VALIDATION RESULTS
Ensures that required fields are present and values are formatted correctly.
For requirements, please refer to the EVA website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/?Submit-Data).
    ✔ Metadata validation check
-
VCF VALIDATION RESULTS
Checks whether each file is compliant with the VCF specification (http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.4.pdf).
Also checks whether the variants' reference alleles match against the reference assembly.
	input_passed.vcf
		✔ Assembly check: 247/247 (100.0%)
		✔ VCF check: 0 critical errors, 0 non-critical errors
-
SAMPLE NAME CONCORDANCE CHECK
Checks whether information in the metadata is concordant with that contained in the VCF files, in particular sample names.
	✔ Analysis A: Sample names in metadata match with those in VCF files
-
REFERENCE GENOME INSDC CHECK
Checks that the reference sequences in the FASTA file used to call the variants are accessioned in INSDC.
Also checks if the reference assembly accession in the metadata matches the one determined from the FASTA file.
	metadata_asm_match.fa
		✔ All sequences are INSDC accessioned.
		✔ Analysis A: Assembly accession in metadata is compatible
